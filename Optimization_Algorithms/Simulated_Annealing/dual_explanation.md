**Explanation:**

1.  **Import `dual_annealing`:** We import the `dual_annealing` function from `scipy.optimize`. We also import `numpy` for setting a seed for reproducibility.
2.  **Objective Function (`objective_function`):** This is the function we want to minimize. In our example, it's $f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 4x - 2y + 5$. The goal of the optimization algorithm is to find the values of $x$ and $y$ within the specified bounds that result in the minimum value of this function.
3.  **Bounds (`bounds`):** We define the search space for each variable. Here, both $x$ and $y$ are constrained to be between -5 and 5.
4.  **Perform Simulated Annealing (`dual_annealing`):**
    * We call the `dual_annealing` function, providing the `objective_function` to be minimized and the `bounds` for the variables.
    * The `seed=42` argument is used to make the results reproducible. Simulated annealing is a stochastic algorithm, so without a fixed seed, you might get slightly different results each time you run it.
5.  **Output:** The `result` object contains information about the optimization process:
    * `result.success`: A boolean indicating if the algorithm converged to a solution.
    * `result.fun`: The minimum value of the objective function found.
    * `result.x`: An array containing the values of the variables ($x$ and $y$) at which the minimum was found.
