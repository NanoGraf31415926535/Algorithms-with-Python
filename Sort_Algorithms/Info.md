# Comparison-based Sorting Algorithms 

As the name suggests, these algorithms sort a collection of items by comparing pairs of elements and deciding their relative order. They rely on the ability to determine if one element is less than, equal to, or greater than another.

**1. Bubble Sort:**

* **How it works:** Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Larger elements "bubble" to the end of the list with each pass.
* **Analogy:** Imagine bubbles rising in water; the larger bubbles reach the surface faster.
* **Example:** Let's sort the list `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
    * **Pass 1:**
        * `(5, 1) -> (1, 5)`
        * `(5, 4) -> (4, 5)`
        * `(5, 2) -> (2, 5)`
        * `(5, 8) -> (5, 8)` (no swap)
        * List becomes: `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]`
    * **Pass 2:**
        * `(1, 4) -> (1, 4)`
        * `(4, 2) -> (2, 4)`
        * `(4, 5) -> (4, 5)`
        * List becomes: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
    * And so on...
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n)$ (when the list is already sorted)
    * **Average Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
    * **Worst Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
* **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (in-place sorting)
* **Stability:** Stable (elements with equal values maintain their relative order)
* **Use Cases:** Simple to understand and implement, but generally inefficient for large datasets. Rarely used in practice except for educational purposes.

**2. Insertion Sort:**

* **How it works:** Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through the input elements and inserts each element into its correct position within the already sorted portion of the array.
* **Analogy:** Think of arranging playing cards in your hand. You pick up a card and insert it into the correct position among the cards you already hold.
* **Example:** Let's sort the list `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
    * Start with `[5]` (considered sorted).
    * Insert `1`: `[1, 5]`
    * Insert `4`: `[1, 4, 5]`
    * Insert `2`: `[1, 2, 4, 5]`
    * Insert `8`: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n)$ (when the list is already sorted)
    * **Average Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
    * **Worst Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$
* **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (in-place sorting)
* **Stability:** Stable
* **Use Cases:** Efficient for small datasets or nearly sorted datasets. Often used as the base case for more complex algorithms like Timsort.

**3. Merge Sort:**

* **How it works:** Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It recursively divides the list into halves until each sublist contains only one element (which is considered sorted). Then, it repeatedly merges the sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sorted list remaining.
* **Analogy:** Think of sorting two piles of already sorted cards by repeatedly picking the smaller card from the top of either pile.
* **Example:** Let's sort the list `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
    * Divide: `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]` $\rightarrow$ `[5, 1]`, `[4, 2, 8]` $\rightarrow$ `[5]`, `[1]`, `[4]`, `[2, 8]` $\rightarrow$ `[5]`, `[1]`, `[4]`, `[2]`, `[8]`
    * Merge: `[1, 5]`, `[2, 4]`, `[8]` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, `[8]` $\rightarrow$ `[1, 2, 4, 5, 8]`
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
    * **Average Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
    * **Worst Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
* **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(n)$ (requires extra space for merging)
* **Stability:** Stable (can be implemented to be stable)
* **Use Cases:** Efficient for large datasets. Often used for external sorting (sorting data that doesn't fit entirely in memory).

**4. Quick Sort:**

* **How it works:** Quick Sort is also a divide and conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the array around the pivot. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved to the left of the pivot, and all elements greater than the pivot are moved to the right. This process is then recursively applied to the sub-arrays on either side of the pivot.
* **Analogy:** Imagine choosing a value as a divider and arranging items into two groups: those smaller and those larger than the divider.
* **Example:** Let's sort the list `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]` (let's choose the first element as the pivot)
    * Pivot = 5
    * Partition: `[1, 4, 2, 5, 8]` (elements smaller than 5 are on the left, larger on the right)
    
    * **Best Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ (when the pivot selection consistently divides the array into roughly equal halves)
    * **Average Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
    * **Worst Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ (when the pivot selection consistently leads to unbalanced partitions, e.g., always picking the smallest or largest element)
* **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ on average due to recursive calls (can be $\mathcal{O}(n)$ in the worst case)
* **Stability:** Not inherently stable (but can be implemented to be stable with extra effort)
* **Use Cases:** Generally one of the fastest general-purpose sorting algorithms in practice. Often used in system sorting routines.

**5. Heap Sort:**

* **How it works:** Heap Sort uses a binary heap data structure to sort elements. It first builds a max-heap (or min-heap) from the input array. Then, it repeatedly extracts the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap and places it at the end of the sorted array.
* **Analogy:** Imagine a tournament where the winner (largest element) moves to the sorted list, and the remaining participants compete again.
* **Example:**
    * Build a max-heap from `[5, 1, 4, 2, 8]`
    * Repeatedly extract the maximum element and rebuild the heap.
* **Time Complexity:**
    * **Best Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
    * **Average Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
    * **Worst Case:** $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$
* **Space Complexity:** $\mathcal{O}(1)$ (in-place sorting)
* **Stability:** Not stable
* **Use Cases:** Guaranteed $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ performance, making it a good choice when consistent performance is important. Useful for priority queue implementations.

**Key Takeaways about Comparison-based Sorting:**

* They rely on comparing elements to determine their order.
* Their theoretical lower bound for the number of comparisons needed to sort $n$ elements is $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$. This means algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort are asymptotically optimal in terms of the number of comparisons.
* The choice of algorithm depends on factors like the size of the dataset, whether it's nearly sorted, memory constraints, and the need for stability.
