# Task: Smart Resource Allocation for a Conference

**Scenario:**

You are organizing a multi-day conference with a variety of workshops and keynote speeches happening in different rooms at different times. You have a limited number of human resources (volunteers) available to assist with various tasks such as registration, room setup, technical support, and guiding attendees. Each task requires a specific number of volunteers and has a specific time slot during the conference. A volunteer can only be assigned to one task at a time.

**Detailed Information:**

1.  **Conference Schedule:** You have a detailed schedule of all events, including:
    * **Event ID:** A unique identifier for each event.
    * **Event Type:** (e.g., Workshop, Keynote, Registration).
    * **Room:** The location where the event takes place.
    * **Start Time:** The exact time the event begins (e.g., Day 1, 9:00 AM).
    * **End Time:** The exact time the event ends (e.g., Day 1, 10:30 AM).

2.  **Task Requirements:** For each event, there might be associated tasks that require volunteer support:
    * **Task ID:** A unique identifier for each task.
    * **Event ID:** The event this task is associated with.
    * **Task Type:** (e.g., Registration Desk, Workshop Setup - Room A, AV Support - Keynote Hall).
    * **Start Time:** The time the volunteer needs to be available for this task. This might be slightly before the event starts (e.g., 15 minutes before for setup).
    * **End Time:** The time the volunteer is no longer needed for this task. This might extend slightly after the event ends (e.g., 15 minutes after for cleanup).
    * **Required Volunteers:** The number of volunteers needed for this specific task.

3.  **Volunteer Availability:** You have a pool of volunteers, and each volunteer has indicated their availability for specific time slots during the conference. This could be represented as:
    * **Volunteer ID:** A unique identifier for each volunteer.
    * **Available Start Time(s):** The time(s) the volunteer becomes available.
    * **Available End Time(s):** The time(s) the volunteer is no longer available.
    * *(For simplicity, let's assume each volunteer has a single continuous block of availability for the entire conference duration for now. We can add complexity later if needed.)*

**The Problem:**

Your goal is to assign volunteers to tasks in a way that maximizes the number of tasks that are fully staffed (i.e., meet the required number of volunteers) while respecting the time constraints and volunteer availability.

**Specific Questions to Address:**

* Can you determine the maximum number of tasks that can be fully staffed with the available volunteers?
* Can you provide an assignment schedule that details which volunteer is assigned to which task and during what time?
* If it's not possible to staff all tasks fully, which tasks will be understaffed, and by how many volunteers?

**Further Considerations (Optional Complexity):**

* Volunteers might have preferences for certain types of tasks.
* Some tasks might have dependencies (e.g., Room Setup must be completed before Registration at that location can start).
* Volunteer availability might have breaks or non-continuous time slots.
